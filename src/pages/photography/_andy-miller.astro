      Andy, who&rsquo;s been living in New York City since 1968, moved into his
      current home in the neighborhood in 1994 with his wife, Irene (pictured on
      the wall, as a baby). Irene died in 2014.

    We met in July 2021 when Andy was heading out for a walk with his dog,
    Esmeralda, and I was photographing on his street. Esmeralda developed
    extensive cancer and was euthanized at home on August 6, 2023 surrounded by
    friends.

      Through Andy, I learned about Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof, a married
      couple and lesser known abstract expressionists from the mid-20th century
      New York scene.

      From 1976 until his death in 2004, Milton Resnick lived and painted in an old
      synagogue building on Eldridge Street. Andy says the building was a sanctuary
      from the madness of the city, and that they used to make oil paints in the
      basement (with wholly inadequate ventilation). These days,{" "}
      <a href="https://www.resnickpasslof.org/">
        The Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof Foundation
      </a>{" "}
      holds exhibits in the building.
