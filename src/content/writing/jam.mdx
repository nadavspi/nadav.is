1. Simmer zest of 5 blood oranges for 30 minutes until tender. (Use a peeler.)

2. Squeeze juice into a measuring cup. Add water (half the volume of juice). 

3. Once cool, slice the zest and add it to the juice. Add a bit of lemon juice.

4. Add sugar (same amount as total volume of juice + zest) and the juice to a pot. Cook 45 minutes, until 225 Â°F.
