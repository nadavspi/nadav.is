Some recent inspiration from a visit to MoMA, and from my photobook collection.

## MoMA
### August Sander

This August Sander collection is a useful study of one of portraiture's big questions: what to do with people's gaze?

(Let us note how many of these photos are titled "… and his Wife".)

## Guido Guidi's In Veneto, 1984-89

My favorite out of several Guido Guidi books that I own.

<Image src={inVeneto_01} alt="Guidi Guidi's photo of a man wearing yellow, sitting on a ledge" />

<Image src={inVeneto_02} alt="Guido Guidi's photo of a person leaning against a car" />

<Image src={inVeneto_3} alt="Guido Guidi's photo of an uncle with his bicycle" />

<Image src={inVeneto_4} alt="Guido Guidi's photo of a young person working in a little shack" />
