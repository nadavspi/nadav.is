As always, this list is not comprehensiveâ€”I could probably make fifty of these without repeating myself and have them all be great.

You may notice all of these are old, from the 50's and 60's. Consider that a form of encouragement to go out and find newer (and older) stuff that's great too.

1. Ella Fitzgerald - *[Ella in Berlin: Mack the Knife][7101-001]*
2. John Coltrane - *[A Love Supreme][7101-002]*
3. Cannonball Adderley - *[The Cannonball Adderley Sextet in New York][7101-003]*
4. Oscar Peterson - *[Trio Live in Chicago][7101-004]*
5. Wayne Shorter - *[Speak No Evil][7101-005]*
6. Ahmad Jamal - *[Cross-Country Tour][7101-006]*
