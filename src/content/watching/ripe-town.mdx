Dark, slow paced mystery set in the Ming dynasty during the 万历 wànlì era (1573-1620). One of the best Chinese shows I've seen; I'd even recommend it to people that aren't interested in Mandarin.

It's slow to build but worth it. Beautifully shot and acted. I don't get the English title; the literal translation "Under the Prosperous City" would've been better, no?
