An utterly formulaic Taiwanese serial killer show: the maverick investigator who will stop at nothing to uncover the truth; the serial killer that turns out to be a psychopath SEX FREAK DJ. The 1990's set design was fun, and I've got to make myself a cable knit sweater like the one his ex[^ex] was wearing.

I stopped watching it when the investigator, a grown ass man, realized that the fact *his own family was brutally murdered and the case was never solved* might explain his obsession with solving this serial killer case.

[^ex]: He broke up with her because he couldn't spend much time with her (because of his obsession with his work) and that's just not right.
